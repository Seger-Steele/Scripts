# ============================================================
# Script: SATBypass.ps1
# Description: Checks all user mailboxes for inbox rules containing "PhishMe" or "Phishing_Training" in their descriptions
#              and logs the findings in the console. 
#             
#              These values are used in Cofense PhishMe email headers when sending a simulated phishing email.
#              This script is used to help identify users who are bypassing the SAT by using these values in their inbox rules.
